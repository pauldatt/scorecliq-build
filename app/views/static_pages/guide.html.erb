  <p>
    Scorecliq offers two plans to its users. When you first sign up, you are assigned an "Individual" plan. 
    This plan is free and offers sufficient functionality for very small leagues/clubs. You have the option to upgrade to 
    a "Master" plan for 29.99 monthly. This plan provides better options for medium to bigger sized leagues. A reference
    is provided which entails the differences between the two plans.
